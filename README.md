Project Overview
The Movie Database Analysis project is all about creating a relational database that stores data about movies, directors, genres, actors, and their relationships. Once we set up the database, we can use SQL queries to derive interesting insights, such as identifying top-rated movies, popular actors, frequent collaborations, and more.

This project gives us experience in the following areas:

Database Design: Creating tables and defining relationships.
Data Insertion: Adding data to the tables to simulate a real-world database.
SQL Querying: Writing and running SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.
Complex Queries: Running complex queries to uncover hidden relationships between data points.
